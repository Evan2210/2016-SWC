	<h1>Displaying Form of Project</h1>
	<p>This project will be a VR-based work, it could be a digital gallery in an immersive way, but meantime it is also a short film and a VR game. Particularly, as a part of this project, participants' experience by wearing oculus rift in the public will also be a performance.</p>
    <h2>Content of the Project</h2>
    <p2> When participants wear the oculus rift, they will first see them in a comic-edition universe with a lot of planets, among which one is with a door. They can pull the door and enter the B612 space. Inside the door, it will be a dispatched world. First, participants may found themselves in a city out of USA, and the city is a combination of virtual world and real world. The real world part may come from a street in China, and the virtual world part will be painted and codeed by me to be inserted into the whole secen. These paintings or gifs will express different issues: culture dislocation,humanity and etc.   </p2>
    <h3>Ideas behind the Project</h3>
    <p3>I have ssen a conflict between digital space and the real world, so I think this conflict will lead to a new space that allow us to embrace them together, instead of body's sitting in the cafe but mind's surfing on the internet. Though technology hasn't pervaded it, there is a trend. We can have a glimpse of such trend from how virus Pokemon Go is. Therefore I want to explore the combination of different spaces earlier than tech totally makes it, in a form and from the angles of arts . 
    For specific idea in the content, it is space dislocation, from the very first exotic sence to the in-between virtuality and reality. Moreover, participant's wearing oculus rift in the public will also be a dislocation that they are walking in the same space with other passengers but they are atcully in another world. So, my audience will be both the participants and all pepole paasing by my participants. </p3>
